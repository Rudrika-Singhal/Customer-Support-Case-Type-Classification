Customer Support Case Type Classification(Classify support cases into billing, technical, or general queries.)
# Customer Support Case Type Classification
This project focuses on classifying customer support cases into three categories: Billing, Technical, or General queries. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze patterns in support messages based on features like message length and response time to accurately categorize incoming queries. This helps streamline customer support operations and improve response efficiency.

📁 Dataset
The dataset includes support cases with the following fields:

message_length: Number of characters in the support message

response_time: Time (in minutes) taken to respond

case_type: Type of case - one of billing, technical, or general

🧠 Objective
To build a classification model that accurately predicts the type of customer query using features like message length and response time.
